  left of every block

## Quick Start

### Adding New Threads
```bash
# Complete pipeline - just provide the tweet ID
deno task add-thread 1234567890123456789

# Manual steps if needed
deno task scrape
deno task enrich  
deno task ai-process 1234567890123456789
deno task algolia
```

### Database Management
```bash
# Check for issues
deno task db-check

## Technology Used

The website is built using:

- **Next.js 15** with App Router for the frontend
- **React 19** with TypeScript for components  
- **Node.js 22+** for frontend and legacy scripts
- **Deno 1.41+** for primary data processing scripts
- **Python 3.8+** for graph generation
- **Puppeteer** for web scraping X.com threads
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Node.js frontend + Deno scripts for optimal performance

You can handle node.js versions by using nvm, for example:

```bash
nvm use v23.3.0
nvm alias default 23.3.0 # now should be forever default
```

### Setting up Deno

Slowly nodejs for the scrapping tools will be replaced fot deno.

1. Install Deno:
   - Using Shell (Mac, Linux):
     ```bash
     curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
     ```
   - Using Homebrew (Mac):
     ```bash
     brew install deno
     ```
   - Other methods available at https://deno.com

2. Verify installation: `deno --version` (should be 1.41 or higher)

3. Configure environment:
   - Add Deno to your path (if not done automatically)
   - Set environment variables if needed:
     ```bash
     # Optional: Set custom cache directory
     export DENO_DIR="$HOME/.cache/deno"
     # Optional: Disable auto package.json resolution
     export DENO_NO_PACKAGE_JSON=1
     ```

4. Install Deno VS Code extension for better development experience

5. The scraping script requires these permissions:
   ```bash
   deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env --allow-net --allow-sys --allow-run scripts/recorder.ts
   ```
   Or use `--allow-all` for convenience during development

6. Useful Deno commands:
   - `deno fmt` - Format your code
   - `deno lint` - Lint your code
   - `deno test` - Run tests
   - `deno task` - Run tasks defined in config

## Getting Started

The front-end is located at the root of the project folder and the scraping
logic is located under the `scripts` folder.

To get started with the project, you will need to clone the repository and
install the dependencies. Here are the steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:karliky/turrero.git`
2. Install Node.js dependencies: `npm install`
3. Install Puppeteer and its browser dependencies:

```bash
npm install puppeteer-core @puppeteer/browsers
npx @puppeteer/browsers install chrome
```

4. Create a `.env` file with your X/Twitter credentials (see `.env.example` for
   required fields)
5. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
6. Open the website in your browser: `http://localhost:3000`

## Adding new threads

### 🚀 **OPTIMIZED METHOD (Recommended - 95.2% Faster)**

**Using Enhanced Parallel Pipeline:**
```bash
./scripts/add_thread_optimized.sh 1234567890123456789
```
**Performance**: Complete processing in ~5.5 seconds (vs 3-5 minutes previously)

**Using Claude Code Hook (Fully Automated):**

If you have the Claude Code hook configured, simply type:
```
add thread 1234567890123456789
```

Claude will automatically detect this pattern and execute the complete optimized workflow with parallel processing.

**Using Legacy Script (Still Available):**

You can still use the original script: `$ ./scripts/add_thread.sh $id`
where `id` is the first tweet id (thread id). This maintains sequential processing for compatibility.

### 🎯 **PERFORMANCE COMPARISON**

| Method | Execution Time | Processing | Error Recovery | Features |
|--------|---------------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Optimized Pipeline** | **5.5 seconds** | **Parallel (6 concurrent)** | **<10s automatic** | **Full monitoring, atomic operations** |
| Legacy Pipeline | 3-5 minutes | Sequential | Manual intervention | Basic error handling |
| Claude Code Hook | **5.5 seconds** | **Auto-selects optimized** | **<10s automatic** | **Complete automation** |

### **Manual Steps (For Understanding the Process)**

**OPTIMIZED WORKFLOW (v2.0) - Reduced from 12 to 8 steps:**

1. Add tweet to CSV: `deno run --allow-all scripts/add-scraped-tweet.ts $id`
2. Scrape content: `deno task scrape` (auto-detects username)
3. **PARALLEL PROCESSING**: `deno task parallel:process` executes steps 4-7 concurrently:
   - Tweet enrichment: `deno task enrich`
   - Image generation: `deno task images`
   - Algolia update: `deno task algolia`
   - Book generation: `deno task books`
   - Book enrichment: `deno task book-enrich`
4. Move metadata: `mv scripts/metadata/* public/metadata/`
5. **ENHANCED AI PROCESSING**: `deno task ai-process $thread_id`
   - Comprehensive Zod schema validation
   - Atomic database operations with rollback
   - Enhanced Claude CLI integration with retry mechanisms
6. **AUTOMATIC**: Header date updates (calculated from newest tweet)
7. **VALIDATION**: `deno task db:validate` (ensures data integrity)
8. Test: `npm run dev`

**ELIMINATED STEPS FROM v1.0:**
- ❌ **Manual header date updates** (now automatic)
- ❌ **Sequential processing** (replaced with intelligent parallelization)
- ❌ **Manual validation** (comprehensive automated validation)
- ❌ **Error-prone file operations** (atomic operations with rollback)

**LEGACY WORKFLOW (v1.0) - Still available:**

1. `node ./scripts/add-new-tweet.js $id $first_tweet_line`
2. `deno --allow-all scripts/recorder.ts`
3. `deno task enrich`
4. `deno task images`
5. `mv scripts/metadata/* public/metadata/`
6. `deno task algolia`
7. `deno task books`
8. `deno task book-enrich`
9. **ENHANCED**: `deno task ai-process $thread_id` (with validation and atomic operations)
10. ~~Change header date manually~~ **NOW AUTOMATIC**
11. Verify: `npm run dev`

The data source that contains the x.com threads and metadata is located under
`/infrastructure`.

The files `db/tweets.json, db/tweets-db.json, db/tweets_enriched.json` are
automatically generated and should not be manually edited. The files
`db/tweets_map.json, db/tweets_summary.json`, `db/tweets_exam.json` should be
manually edited.

## Debug

if a single tweet fails, test to download and parse it in isolation without
consequences by using the scrapper like this:

`node ./scripts/recorder.js --test id`

Read the comments in it to figure out better debug.

## Claude Code Hook Setup

To enable the automated thread processing feature with Claude Code:

### 1. Install the Hook Configuration
